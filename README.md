## Risk Scoring

VIPER calculates a combined risk score for each vulnerability using:
- Gemini AI priority assessment (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- CVSS v3 score (0-10 scale)
- EPSS score (probability of exploitation)
- CISA KEV status (with a customizable boost factor)
- Microsoft severity rating (Critical, Important, Moderate, Low)
- Public exploit availability (with a customizable boost factor)

The weights for each factor can be configured via environment variables:
- `RISK_WEIGHT_GEMINI` (default: 0.4)
- `RISK_WEIGHT_CVSS` (default: 0.3)
- `RISK_WEIGHT_EPSS` (default: 0.3)
- `RISK_WEIGHT_MS_SEVERITY` (default: 0.2)
- `KEV_BOOST_FACTOR` (default: 0.5)
- `PUBLIC_EXPLOIT_BOOST_FACTOR` (default: 0.15) - Boosts risk scores for CVEs with confirmed public exploits

## Alert Generation

VIPER generates alerts based on configurable rules:
1. Critical Exploitability Risk - CVEs with very high EPSS scores
2. Severe Impact & Likely Exploit - High CVSS score combined with significant EPSS score
3. High Impact Technique - CVEs matching specific keywords with substantial EPSS scores
4. AI Flagged - CVEs rated as HIGH priority by Gemini AI
5. CISA KEV Status - CVEs in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog
6. Microsoft Critical - CVEs rated as Critical severity by Microsoft

Alert thresholds can be configured via environment variables (see config.py).

## PDF Export Feature

VIPER provides the ability to export detailed vulnerability analysis reports as PDF documents. 

### Using the PDF Export Feature

1. Navigate to the "Detailed Vulnerability Analysis" page in the dashboard
2. Select a CVE from the dropdown menu to view its details
3. Scroll to the bottom of the vulnerability details
4. Click the "Export Analysis Report (PDF)" button
5. Save the generated PDF to your preferred location

### What's Included in the PDF Report

The PDF report includes:

- **Summary Information**: CVE ID, priority level, CISA KEV status, etc.
- **Description**: The full vulnerability description
- **Risk Metrics**: CVSS score, EPSS score, risk score, etc.
- **AI Analysis**: The AI assessment of the vulnerability
- **Alerts and Concerns**: Any specific alerts related to the vulnerability
- **Recommended Actions**: Mitigation recommendations based on priority level
- **References**: Links to relevant resources
- **Affected Products**: CPE entries for affected systems

## 🔍 Public Exploit Search

The Public Exploit Search feature allows VIPER to search for and identify publicly available exploits for vulnerabilities, adding critical context to your risk assessments:

* **Multi-Source Exploit Search:** 
  * Searches Exploit-DB for known exploits related to CVEs
  * Searches GitHub repositories and code for exploit proof-of-concepts
  * Results are cached to minimize API calls

### GitHub Exploit Search

VIPER includes robust functionality to search GitHub for exploits and proof-of-concept code related to CVEs:

* **Comprehensive GitHub Search:**
  * Searches both repositories and code files for each CVE
  * Uses multiple targeted queries (`exploit`, `PoC`, `proof of concept`)
  * Filters results to find genuine exploits using content analysis
  * Includes repository metadata such as star count and descriptions


### GitHub API Configuration

To enable GitHub exploit searching, you need to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create a token with the `public_repo` scope (this is enough for searching public repositories)
   - For newer GitHub accounts, you'll need to create a "Fine-grained token" or a "Classic token"

2. **Add the token to your .env file**:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

3. **Additional exploit search configuration options**:
   ```
   # GitHub API URL (defaults to https://api.github.com)
   GITHUB_API_URL=https://api.github.com
   
   # Exploit-DB API URL (defaults to https://exploits.shodan.io/api)
   EXPLOIT_DB_API_URL=https://exploits.shodan.io/api
   
   # Maximum results per exploit source (defaults to 10)
   EXPLOIT_SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS=10
   
   # Risk score boost for vulnerabilities with public exploits (0.0-1.0, defaults to 0.15)
   PUBLIC_EXPLOIT_BOOST_FACTOR=0.15
   ```

If no GitHub token is provided, the system will skip GitHub searches and only use Exploit-DB as a source.

## Project Roadmap & Future Vision

VIPER aims to be a comprehensive, AI-driven Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform, drawing inspiration from advanced, multi-layered CTI systems. Our current version provides a strong foundation with NVD, EPSS, CISA KEV, and Microsoft MSRC data ingestion, coupled with Gemini AI for analysis, risk scoring, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard with real-time CVE lookup.

Here's where we're headed:

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements & Data Completeness (Immediate Focus)

* **Full NVD API Pagination:** Ensure complete ingestion of all relevant CVEs from NVD by implementing robust pagination in `nvd_client.py` to handle large result sets (addressing current partial data fetching ).
* **Solidify Retry Mechanisms:** Continuously refine and test `tenacity` based retry logic across all external API clients (`nvd_client.py`, `epss_client.py`, `cisa_kev_client.py`, `microsoft_update_client.py`, `gemini_analyzer.py`) for maximum resilience.
* **Dashboard Usability & Features:**
    * Refine real-time CVE lookup: Optimize display and ensure all enrichment (EPSS, KEV, MSData, Gemini re-analysis) is available for live queries.
    * Enhance filtering and sorting options on all data tables.
    * Implement detailed CVE view modals or dedicated pages for better readability of all enriched data.
* **Automated Periodic Execution:** Integrate `APScheduler` or configure system `cron` jobs to run the `main_mvp.py` data pipeline automatically at configurable intervals.

### Phase 2: Expanding Data Ingestion & Enrichment

* **[ ] MalwareBazaar Integration:**
    * Fetch data on recent malware samples, hashes, and associated threat intelligence.
    * Store and display this information, potentially linking malware IOCs to CVEs or threat actors.
* **[ ] Other CISA Products & Feeds:**
    * Explore and integrate other relevant CISA feeds beyond the KEV catalog (e.g., CISA Alerts, Industrial Control Systems Advisories if applicable).
* **[ ] Comprehensive Microsoft Patch Tuesday Parsing:**
    * Further refine `microsoft_update_client.py` to ensure accurate and detailed extraction of product families, specific product versions, and direct links to KB articles/MSRC guidance from CVRF/CSAF data.

### Phase 3: Developing "Threat Analyst Agent" Capabilities

* **[ ] Semantic Web Search Integration (e.g., EXA AI):**
    * For high-priority CVEs or emerging threats, automatically search the web for technical analyses, blog posts, news articles, and threat actor reports.
    * Store relevant article metadata (URL, title, snippet, source) linked to CVEs.
* **[ ] AI-Powered Content Analysis (Gemini):**
    * **Summarization:** Use Gemini to summarize fetched articles and reports related to a CVE.
    * **Key Information Extraction:** Extract TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), affected software/hardware, and potential mitigations from unstructured text.
    * **Cross-Validation Support:** Assist analysts by comparing information from different sources regarding a specific threat.

### Phase 4: Building "Threat Hunting Agent" Foundations

* **[ ] Enhanced IOC Extraction:**
    * Expand IOC (IPs, domains, hashes, URLs, mutexes, registry keys) extraction from all ingested text sources (NVD descriptions, MSRC summaries, KEV details, fetched articles) using Gemini's advanced understanding or specialized libraries like `iocextract`.
    * Create a robust, searchable IOC database.
* **[ ] Natural Language to Query Translation (Advanced):**
    * Leverage Gemini to translate natural language threat hunting hypotheses (e.g., "Are there any Cobalt Strike beacons communicating with newly registered domains?") into structured query formats like OCSF, KQL (Azure Sentinel), or Splunk SPL.

### Phase 5: Broader Intelligence Gathering & Advanced Analytics

* **[ ] Social Media Monitoring & Clustering (Advanced):**
    * Ingest data from platforms like Twitter/X or specific Reddit communities (e.g., r/netsec) for early signals of new vulnerabilities or exploits.
    * Apply LLM-based semantic clustering (Gemini) to group discussions and identify emerging threat trends.
* **[ ] Threat Actor & Malware Profiling:**
    * Begin associating CVEs and IOCs with known threat actors and malware families (potentially integrating with MISP or other OSINT feeds).
    * Visualize these relationships in the dashboard.
* **[ ] Advanced Dashboard Analytics:**
    * Implement more sophisticated trend analysis, predictive insights (beyond EPSS), and customizable reporting features.

### Phase 6: Platform Maturity & Usability

* **[ ] User Accounts & Collaboration (Long-term):** Allow multiple users, role-based access, and collaborative analysis features (e.g., shared notes, investigation assignments).
* **[ ] Notification System:** Implement email or other notifications for high-priority alerts or newly discovered critical CVEs matching predefined criteria.
* **[ ] Database Optimization/Migration:** For larger deployments, consider migrating from SQLite to a more scalable database like PostgreSQL.

This roadmap is ambitious and will evolve. Community contributions and feedback are highly encouraged as we build VIPER into a powerful open-source CTI tool!
